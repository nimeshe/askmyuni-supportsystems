D1: MyUni Systems Foundations,"Core backend: DB, API, IaC, CI/CD, Static Website","To Do","Epic",
D1.1: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform),"Setup minimal Terraform:
- Create Firestore DB
- Create Cloud Storage bucket (static website)
- Create Cloud Run service placeholder
- Create service accounts
(HINT: Keep Terraform tiny; just enough to give confidence)", "To Do","infra","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"
D1.2: Define Database Schema,"Create Firestore collections:
- students
- courses
- enrolments
(HINT: Only add fields needed for general enquiries)", "To Do","database","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"
D1.3: Migration Simulation Framework,"Create folder `migrations/`
- 0001_init.py
- simple migration runner
(HINT: Not real migrations; simulating process for learning)", "To Do","database","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"
D1.4: Backend API Skeleton,"FastAPI project with 2 endpoints:
- GET /public/courses
- GET /public/courses/{id}
(HINT: pure read-only for now)", "To Do","api","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"
D1.5: Load Sample Data,"Add JSON/CSV file with:
- 5 sample courses
- Intake dates
(HINT: simple data, no complexity)", "To Do","database","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"
D1.6: Static Website,"Create Cloud Storage static site:
- Basic HTML page
- List of courses
(HINT: do NOT overthink design)", "To Do","web","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"
D1.7: CI/CD Pipeline for MyUni API,"Cloud Build trigger:
- Build container
- Run migrations
- Deploy to Cloud Run
(HINT: small and simple)", "To Do","cicd","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"
D1.8: Backups,"Automate weekly DB export:
- Scheduled Cloud Function
(HINT: one-liner export, no restore yet)", "To Do","infra","D1: MyUni Systems Foundations"

D2: AskMyUni Agentic Foundations,"Build orchestrator skeleton + fake agents + CI/CD","To Do","Epic",
D2.1: Orchestrator Skeleton,"Create Cloud Run function:
- POST /processEmail
- Hardcoded example output
(HINT: focus on workflow shell)", "To Do","orchestrator","D2: AskMyUni Agentic Foundations"
D2.2: Agent_VerifyIdentity (Fake V0),"Fake verification agent returns:
{ identityVerified: true }
(HINT: no security yet)", "To Do","agent","D2: AskMyUni Agentic Foundations"
D2.3: Agent_L1Support (Fake V0),"Basic categorisation:
- Always return 'General'
- Generic response string", "To Do","agent","D2: AskMyUni Agentic Foundations"
D2.4: Minimal Workflow,"Implement:
- verifyIdentity()
- l1Support()
- return combined result
(HINT: no parallel logic yet)", "To Do","orchestrator","D2: AskMyUni Agentic Foundations"
D2.5: CI/CD Pipeline (AskMyUni),"Cloud Build trigger for orchestrator:
- Build
- Deploy to Cloud Run", "To Do","cicd","D2: AskMyUni Agentic Foundations"
D2.6: Logging/Observability Setup,"Add:
- correlation IDs
- simple structured logs
(HINT: minimal structuredJSON output)", "To Do","logging","D2: AskMyUni Agentic Foundations"

D3: AskMyUni MVP,"General enquiry support working end-to-end","To Do","Epic",
D3.1: L1 Agent V1,"Add:
- Query classification (General vs Unknown)
- Fetch data from MyUni API
(HINT: first real tool use)", "To Do","agent","D3: AskMyUni MVP"
D3.2: Orchestrator Parallel Pattern,"Implement:
- Parallel verifyIdentity + analyzeQuery
- Wait for verification step
(HINT: identity still fake but structure real)", "To Do","orchestrator","D3: AskMyUni MVP"
D3.3: Human Escalation (General),"If Unknown:
- create fake Supervisor ticket
- include summary + raw query", "To Do","escalation","D3: AskMyUni MVP"
D3.4: Knowledge Base Integration,"Use MyUni public API as 'KB'
(HINT: no RAG yet, just real data fetch)", "To Do","agent","D3: AskMyUni MVP"
D3.5: Output Formatter,"Standard JSON output format:
- path
- agent outputs
- final message", "To Do","orchestrator","D3: AskMyUni MVP"

D4: MyUni Systems MVP,"Backend enhancements required for AskMyUni MVP","To Do","Epic",
D4.1: Expand Course Schema,"Add fields:
- duration
- fee
- campus
- intakes", "To Do","database","D4: MyUni Systems MVP"
D4.2: Add Public API Filters,"GET /public/courses?campus&year", "To Do","api","D4: MyUni Systems MVP"
D4.3: Load Expanded Sample Data,"Add data for:
- 5–6 courses
- Term calendar", "To Do","database","D4: MyUni Systems MVP"
